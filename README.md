#### Discretized Objective Function Optimization via Stepwise Selection

The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently weight the allocation of stocks in a portfolio such that the Sharpe Ratio is maximized. There are several methods in which one can do this

1) Grid Search (Discretized Dynamical System)
The standard Grid Search considers every possible combination of weights for the stocks in each portfolio. It iterates over each stock weight, by first finding the optimal value of each stock and then tweaking all other stock values. The algorithm can then be repeated to ensure convergence to a global maxima.

2) Random Search



3) Simulated Aneeling
